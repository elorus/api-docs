### 1.1 Create a new contact

_\- The guide assumes you're working on a new Elorus organization, so this step can be omitted._  
  
First lets create a contact so there is someone to bill. Since the case is a "Retail Sales Receipt" no VAT number is needed and only minimal contact information will be used. In a business context, contacts are individuals or businesses whom you transact with; typically your clients, leads, suppliers and partners. Since Elorus will let you manage your sales as well as your expenses, a contact may represent either a client or a supplier (or even both).

Receipt creation
----------------

### 4.1 Create Retail Sales Receipt

The final step, is to create the Receipt itself. The list below describes all the needed fields.

1.  X-Elorus-Organization: your organization ID
2.  calculator\_mode: sets your values as "initial" or "total", meaning before or after taxes.
    1.  When "total" is used, then it is mandatory to use "unit\_total" in items.
    2.  When "initial" is used, then it is mandatory to use "unit\_value" in items.
    3.  Depending on the situation, Elorus will calculate the taxes accordingly.
3.  client: Client id - In this case we created a "ΠΕΛΑΤΗΣ ΛΙΑΝΙΚΗΣ" contact.
4.  draft: true or false depending on the need to issue immediately an invoice or not. If true, the invoice will not reach MyData/Softone, until issued.
5.  documenttype: Document Type ID - In this case we created a "ΑΠΟΔΕΙΞΗ ΛΙΑΝΙΚΗΣ ΠΩΛΗΣΗΣ" document type, associated with the corresponding "aade type".
6.  My data specific fields: mydata\_document\_type - mydata\_classification\_category - mydata\_classification\_type - paid\_on\_receipt - payment\_method
    1.  mydata\_document\_type: aade type
    2.  mydata\_classification\_category: income type aade
    3.  mydata\_classification\_type: classifications of Ε3 aade
    4.  paid\_on\_receipt: Invoice amount that was paid when invoice was issued. If "0" then you don't need to send payment\_method since Elorus will automatically apply payment\_method as on credit.
    5.  payment\_method:
        1.  “1”: Domestic Payments Account
        2.  “2”: Foreign Payments Account
        3.  “3”: Cash
        4.  “4”: Cheque
        5.  “6”: Web Banking
        6.  “7”: POS / e-POS
