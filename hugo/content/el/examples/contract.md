### 1.1 Create a new contact

_\- The guide assumes you're working on a new Elorus organization, so this step can be omitted._  
  
First lets create a contact so there is someone to receive payment from. In a business context, contacts are individuals or businesses whom you transact with; typically your clients, leads, suppliers and partners. Since Elorus will let you manage your sales as well as your expenses, a contact may represent either a client or a supplier (or even both).

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Token ~Your-API-key~" -H "X-Elorus-Organization: ~Your-Organization-ID~" https://api.elorus.com/v1.1/contacts/ -d '{"client_type": "1", "company":"Elorus SA", "vat_number":"0123456789", "addresses":[{"address":"Theofilopoulou 13", "city":"Athens", "zip":"11743", "country": "GR", "ad_type": "bill"}], "is_client": true, "is_supplier":false}'

Taxes

### 2.1 About taxes

By default there are some taxes preset in Elorus. Usually 24% tax is used for Greece "Contract Income" so the preset tax will be retrieved and used. In case there is a need for a new tax to be created, use of Elorus' UI is mandatory.  
Optional steps to create new tax:

1.  Login to your Elorus account
2.  Go to: "Settings -> Taxes"
3.  Click "+Add" on top right corner
4.  And set it up as the picture below. AADE category and title used are for example purposes. ![](/img/examples/common/tax.png)
5.  Click "Save"

  

### 2.2 Get taxes ID

Search by "percentage", to get the tax ID. Retrieved tax ID in this case is "2476911428611605999". Make sure that "aade\_type":1 is in the response packet.  
  

{{< curl-block >}}
curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Token ~Your-API-key~" -H "X-Elorus-Organization: ~Your-Organization-ID~" https://api.elorus.com/v1.1/taxes/?search="24"&search_fields=percentage
