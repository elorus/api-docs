<b>Warning!</b>
<ul>
<li>In case the SoftOne EINVOICING integration is activated in your organization, special attention is needed as it's not possible to cancel the submission, and creating a credit note is not an option either.</li>
<li>If the "Accommodation Tax" is linked to a "Sales Invoice", the invoice must have been submitted to myDATA prior to submitting the "Accommodation Tax".</li>

Client

### 1.1 Create a new contact

_\- The guide assumes you're working on a new Elorus organization, so this step can be omitted._  
  
First lets create a contact so there is someone to bill. In a business context, contacts are individuals or businesses whom you transact with; typically your clients, leads, suppliers and partners. Since Elorus will let you manage your sales as well as your expenses, a contact may represent either a client or a supplier (or even both).

### 1.2 Get contact ID

Filter e.g. by "company", to get the contact ID. Retrieved contact ID in this case is "2480647926494267071".  
  

{{< curl-block >}}
curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Token ~Your-API-key~" -H "X-Elorus-Organization: ~Your-Organization-ID~" https://api.elorus.com/v1.1/contacts/?company="Elorus SA"

Taxes

### 2.1 Create Rental Income

First, by going to the Elorus' UI > menu Settings > Taxes > Add, you must enter the "Accommodation Tax" that applies to your business. 

It is a one-time process to activate the ability to add "Accommodation Tax" to your account from now on. ![](/img/examples/accommodation-tax.png)

### 2.2 Get taxes ID

Search by "title" e.g. "Ξενοδοχεία 3 αστέρων", to get the tax ID. Retrieved tax ID in this case is "2624067035251869663".

{{< curl-block >}}
curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Token ~Your-API-key~" -H "X-Elorus-Organization: ~Your-Organization-ID~" https://api.elorus.com/v1.1/taxes/?search="Ξενοδοχεία 3 αστέρων"&search_fields=title

### 3.1 Create Accommodation Tax

The final step, is to create the "Accommodation Tax" as a received payment. The list below describes all the needed fields.

1. X-Elorus-Organization: your organization ID
2. date: Issue date
3. transaction_type:"at". Required field to denote the received payment as "Accommodation Tax".
4. taxes: The amount charged depends on the category of accommodation (e.g. a hotel with three stars is taxed differently to a hotel that has one star). 
5. quantity: Calculate the total tax rate as the product of the fixed amount (depends on the category of accommodation), multiplied by the quantity.
6. contact: Contact id - In this case we created "Elorus SA" contact.
7. at_invoice: Not required. Used when there is a need to relate an invoice with the received "Accommodation Tax" payment.
8. myDATA specific fields:
    *   mydata\_document\_type: aade type **8.2 for "Accommodation Tax"**
    *   payment\_method:
